abstract: Identifying hepatotoxicity as early as possible is significant in drug development. In this study, we developed a
drug-induced hepatotoxicity prediction model taking account of both the biological context and the computational efficacy
based on toxicogenomics data. Specifically, we proposed a novel gene selection algorithm considering geneâ€™s participation,
named BioCB, to choose the discriminative genes and make more efficient prediction. Then instead of using the raw gene
expression levels to characterize each drug, we developed a two-dimensional biological process feature pattern map to
represent each drug. Then we employed two strategies to handle the maps and identify the hepatotoxicity, the direct use of
maps, named Two-dim branch, and vectorization of maps, named One-dim branch. The two strategies subsequently used
the deep convolutional neural networks and LightGBM as predictors, respectively. Additionally, we here for the first time
proposed a stacked vectorized gene matrix, which was more predictive than the raw gene matrix. Results validated on both
in vivo and in vitro data from two public data sets, the TG-GATES and DrugMatrix, show that the proposed One-dim branch
outperforms the deep framework, the Two-dim branch, and has achieved high accuracy and efficiency. The implementation
of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/RanSuLab/Hepatotoxicity.
