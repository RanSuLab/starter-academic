abstract: Recursive feature elimination (RFE), as one of the most popular feature selection algorithms, has been extensively applied to
bioinformatics. During the training, a group of candidate subsets are generated by iteratively eliminating the least important
features from the original features. However, how to determine the optimal subset from them still remains ambiguous.
Among most current studies, either overall accuracy or subset size (SS) is used to select the most predictive features. Using
which one or both and how they affect the prediction performance are still open questions. In this study, we proposed
MinE-RFE, a novel RFE-based feature selection approach by sufficiently considering the effect of both factors. Subset
decision problem was ref lected into subset-accuracy space and became an energy-minimization problem.We also provided
a mathematical description of the relationship between the overall accuracy and SS using Gaussian Mixture Models
together with spline fitting. Besides, we comprehensively reviewed a variety of state-of-the-art applications in
bioinformatics using RFE.We compared their approaches of deciding the final subset from all the candidate subsets with
MinE-RFE on diverse bioinformatics data sets. Additionally, we also compared MinE-RFE with some well-used feature
selection algorithms. The comparative results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits the best performance
among all the approaches. To facilitate the use of MinE-RFE, we further established a user-friendly web server with the
implementation of the proposed approach, which is accessible at http://qgking.wicp.net/MinE/.We expect this web server
will be a useful tool for research community.
