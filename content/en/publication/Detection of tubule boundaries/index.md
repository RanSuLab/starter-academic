abstract: In studies of germ cell transplantation, counting cells and measuring tubule diameters from different populations using labelled antibodies are important measurement processes. However, it is slow and sanity grinding to do these tasks manually. This paper proposes a way to accelerate these processes using a new image analysis framework based on several novel algorithms: centre points detection of tubules, tubule shape classification, skeleton-based polar-transformation, boundary weighting of polar-transformed image, and circular shortest path smoothing. The framework has been tested on a dataset consisting of 27 images which contain a total of 989 tubules. Experiments show that the detection results of our algorithm are very close to the results obtained manually and the novel approach can achieve a better performance than two existing methods.
