abstract: Feature enhancement is an important preprocessing step in many image processing tasks. It is the process of adjusting image intensities so that the enhanced results are more suitable for analysis. Good enhancement results for linear structures such as vessels or neurites can be used as inputs for segmentation and other operations. In this paper, a novel linear feature enhancement filter – an adaptive multi-scale morpho-Gaussian filter – which can enhance and smooth linear features is proposed based on morphological operation, anisotropic Gaussian function and Hessian information. This filter can enhance and smooth along the local orientation of the linear structures and the Hessian measurement is used to further enhance the linear features. We utilize the Hessian matrix to calculate the orientation information for our directional morphological operation and the oriented anisotropic Gaussian smoothing. We also propose a novel method for junction enhancement, which can solve the problem of junction suppression. We decompose the junctions and enhance along each linear structure within a junction region. We present the test results of our algorithm on images of different types and compare our method with three existing methods. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve better results.
