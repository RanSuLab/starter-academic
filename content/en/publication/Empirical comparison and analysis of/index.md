abstract: Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) facilitate the delivery of therapeutically relevant molecules, including DNA, proteins and oligonucleotides, into cells both in vitro and in vivo. This unique ability explores the possibility of CPPs as therapeutic delivery and its potential applications in clinical therapy. Over the last few decades, a number of machine learning-based prediction tools have been developed, and some of them are freely available as web portals. However, the predictions produced by various tools is difficult to quantify and compare. In particular, there is no systematic comparison of the web-based prediction tools in performance, especially in practical applications. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review on the biological importance of CPPs, CPP database, and existing machine learning based methods for CPP prediction. To evaluate current prediction tools, we conducted a comparative study and analyzed a total of 12 models from six publicly available CPP prediction tools on two benchmark validation sets of CPPs and non-CPPs. Our benchmarking results demonstrated that a model from the KELM-CPPpred, namely KELM-hybrid-AAC, showed a significant improvement in overall performance, when compared to the other 11 prediction models. Moreover, through a length-dependency analysis, we find that existing prediction tools tend to more accurately predict CPPs and non-CPPs with the length of 20-25 residues long than peptides in other length ranges.
