abstract: Protein subcellular localization (PSL), as one of the most critical characteristics of human cells, plays an
important role for understanding specific functions and biological processes in cells. Accurate prediction
of protein subcellular localization is a fundamental and challenging problem, for which machine learning
algorithms have been widely used. Traditionally, the performance of PSL prediction highly depends on
handcrafted feature descriptors to represent proteins. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a
hot research topic in the field of machine learning, achieving outstanding success in learning high-level
latent features within data samples. In this paper, to accurately predict protein subcellular locations, we
propose a deep learning based predictor called DeepPSL by using Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) networks.
In this predictor, we automatically learn high-level and abstract feature representations of proteins by
exploring non-linear relations among diverse subcellular locations, addressing the problem of the need
of handcrafted feature representations. Experimental results evaluated with three-fold cross validation
show that the proposed DeepPSL outperforms traditional machine learning based methods. It is expected
that DeepPSL, as the first predictor in the field of PSL prediction, has great potential to be a powerful
computational method complementary to existing tools.
